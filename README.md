# Dissociation-Assay
Fiji Macros developed for the Research Internship II in Translational Medicine at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.

To install this macro pack into your Fiji, copy all lines in the .ijm file. Open your Startup Macros file in Fiji by clicking on Plugins > Macros > Startup Macros... 
Paste the copied lines into that file just below the line "function required 138b() {requires("1.38b"); return 0; }", presently located in line 82. Please note that the version number "1.38b" could be replaced by a different one in your version. 

Afterwards, save by pressing Ctrl+S and close the macro editor. Then, press the two arrows in the toolbar on the right side (>>) and click on "Restore Startup Tools". A button named "DA" should appear, containing all the different macros.
